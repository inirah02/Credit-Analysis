# Credit-Analysis

Conducted an exploratory data analysis on the credit dataset. We explored the data, identified categorical and numeric variables, calculated descriptive statistics, and investigated the relationships between variables using correlation analysis and chi-squared tests. Additionally, we built a decision tree model to predict credit defaults based on other attributes.

The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable in understanding patterns and trends in credit applications, helping financial institutions make informed decisions and improve risk assessment processes.
